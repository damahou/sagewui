.. nodoctest

This is a major refactor/rewrite of the Sage Notebook.

Goals
=====

* Make the notebook independent from Sage, so that it can be launched from an
  independent python interpreter.

* Break the notebook in several packages (WebApp, sage_server interface,
  model, controller, ...) useful to develop other independent software.

* Objects must be processed by the client for displaying. No more html
  representation of objects must be generated by the server. Establish
  a clear web server API, so that different web clients could be
  implemented.

* Improve maintainability.

* Improve security, both in the WebApp and in the sage_server interactions.

* Improve scalability.

* Python 3 migration.

Status
======

* Notebook startup procedure has been changed. No need for intermediate startup
  code files. Standalone command interface. Debug mode added. Work in progress.

* Sage server interface partially isolated (except interact mechanism). No
  need for intermediate code files. Code is passed directly to the
  Sage server. Sage initialization left to the sage_server interface.
  Work in progress.

* Some Notebook bugs fixed (and surely a lot of new bugs added).

* Currently reformatting code and isolating interdependencies.

* Backward compatibility is not a goal, but at this moment this version
  can be used as a replacement of the current Sage Notebook.

* Some Notebook features could be removed.

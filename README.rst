.. nodoctest

This is a major refactor/rewrite of the Sage Notebook.

Goals
=====

* Make the notebook independent from Sage, so that it can be launched from an
  independent python interpreter.

* Break the notebook in several packages (WebApp, sage_server interface,
  model, controller, ...) useful to develop other independent software.

* Objects must be processed by the client for displaying. No more html
  representation of objects must be generated by the server. Establish
  a clear web server API, so that different web clients could be
  implemented.
  
* All the interact code must be refactored. The sage server must be only used 
  as a computing tool, not as a HTML widget generator.

* Improve maintainability.

* Improve security, both in the WebApp and in the sage_server interactions.

* Improve scalability.

* Python 3 migration.

Status
======

* Notebook startup procedure has been changed. No need for intermediate startup
  code files. Standalone command interface. Debug mode added. Work in progress.

* Sage server interface totally isolated. No
  need for intermediate code files. Code is passed directly to the
  Sage server. Sage initialization left to the sage_server interface.
  Work in progress.

* New flask json session mechanism adopted.

* A new package sagegui created. It runs on a indpendent python interpreter.
  First goal reached. 

* smtpsend is now a global module (second goal partially achieved).

* The dependencies for sagegui are: twisted, flask,
  flask-openid, flask-autoindex, flask-babel
  flask-themes2, six, smtpsend, pexpect, docutils. All of them, but smtpsend
  which is in the source tree, are installable from pipy in an virtual
  python environment.

* sagenb package contains only sage compatibility code, but not completed.
  Work in progress.

* A lot of reformatting, bug fixing and simplification of code done.
  Work in progress.

* A lot of work towards python 3 done.
  Work in progress.

Notes
=====

* Backward compatibility is not a goal, but at this moment this version
  can be used as a replacement of the current Sage Notebook.

* Some Notebook features could be removed.

See http://wiki.sagemath.org/SageTasks for a related list.

[ ] admin should *NOT* see all users worksheets.  This is not good, e.g., 
when there are 50,000 worksheets!

[ ] Clicking publish should update the "last changed" time.  E.g.,
take an old worksheet and publish it -- should always make it new.

[ ] change number word wrap columns in notebook settings has no immediate
impact, though it does after restarting the server. 

[ ] implement base_url

[ ] make communication between twist.py and notebook_lib.js use JSON
instead of encode_list and response_text.split.

[ ] Get peter.jipsen's "canvas3d_lib.js + Pre3d does shaded surfaces" into Sage

[ ] codenode's engine/interpreter.py has a function with this comment:
        """input_string could contain multiple lines, multiple commands, or
        multiple multiline commands. This method builds a compiled command
        line by line until a complete command has been compiled. Once it
        has a complete command, it execs it in the username space and the
        output is stored in the output trap. There may be more than one
        command; the number of complete commands is counted
        (Based off of ipython1.core.shell.InteractiveShell._runlines)"""
This approach means that in codenode we would have
{{{
a = 5; b = 7
a+b
a-b
print a*b
///
12
-2
35
}}}
which is more natural, since it mimics the command line.   We should change
Sage so it does the same.  I think this would simply involving changing the
interfaces/* stuff a little.  This is probably easy, and is now high priority
since it is something that has bugged me for a long time. 

[ ] idea from codenode: in their revisions log they label each
 revision with two columns, one being the last changed input in that
 worksheet (meant to jar ones memory), and second the total number of
 cells.

[ ] "shift-enter to save tinymce cell" on safari goes "beep", which is
annoying

[ ] make it possible to set the default font in tinymce

[ ] The startup of the notebook involves reading all the directories
and creating worksheets.  This takes anywhere from 5 minutes to an
*hour* with sagenb.org.  So this *must* be fixed to be massively
faster.  This is a top optimization priority.

[ ] download just the text version of the worksheet

[ ] "untitled renaming".  Make it an option in the user confs, which
is on by default, by you can turn it off.


[ ] get coverage to 100%.


[ ] we can make it so that if worksheet.html file changes on disk but
not currently open, then when reopen it uses the new version from
disk.  More precisely, make it so "save and quit" deletes body of
worksheet, so if user opens that worksheet again it'll grab the
content from disk.

[ ] page through list of worksheets (don't show hundreds at once)

[ ] do something about this in worksheet.py
    def autosave(self, username):
        return

[ ] add info about when user last logged in to user.py.

[ ] way to send all registered users an email

[ ] instructions about running a daemon sage server with conf scripts:
http://groups.google.com/group/sage-support/browse_thread/thread/b0d15b82eea3d652

[ ] "data" link appears in reference implementation in output of every cell

[ ] filesize limit -- option so that any computation that produces a
file that exceeds a certain size would get deleted and replaced by a
message.  This would limit (though not prevent) damages.

[ ] Jonathan Gutow -- redo how jmol works



[ ] maybe get rid of list of 'Sage Users' when publishing worksheets --
that's not appropriate given how sage has grown.

[ ] notebook(default_mode="python") way to make the notebook default
to use python instead of sage.

[ ] fulltext -- when output long, make it all available with a link
even before computation finishes, and definitely if it is interrupted!

[ ] write an overview of how the sage notebook works:
http://wiki.sagemath.org/SageNotebook

[ ] switch from twisted.web2 to twisted.web.  Alex Clemesha says
"Pretty easily actually... the Resource object is pretty similar, the
main difference is that the Web2 Resource object has the "locateChild"
method, where as the Web Resource has "getChild" - and even those are
pretty similar.  Also, there's some subtle differences in the way you
doing "rendering"... i.e. with Web2 you subclass
Resource/PostableResource and then you use the "render" method, where
are with Web you just subclass Resource and implemented either
"render_GET" or "render_POST".  Probably just looking through the
examples here: http://jcalderone.livejournal.com/tag/sixty+seconds
would be good enough to do the switch."

[ ] move is_valid_username (etc.) out of twist.py, which is definitely *not*
where it belongs

[ ] ldap support (see, eg., http://math.univ-lyon1.fr/~tdumont/sage)  but make
sure to first abstract away authentication first so it is much CLEARER.


[ ] find a way to provide same info as data directory but without making it
super-permissive.  Maybe I can make an api for getting files from a data
location or something...

[ ] control-c doesn't quite work for reference implementation quitting notebook
server


[ ] make it so uploading a worksheet does not lock the server like it does now.

[ ] secure mode outside of sage -- fix it to work with openssl, etc.

[ ] more stress testing, etc., using mechanize:
http://wwwsearch.sourceforge.net/mechanize/

[ ] have a worksheet export screen and the option to save just certain
parts (e.e., images, DATA, etc.) with checkboxes.

[ ] change api for notebook command; in particular enable capability
    to have different sage command on remote machine

[ ] worksheet processes using named pipes

[ ] code to benchmark notebook externally

[ ] implement %cython mode outside sage (and as a full mode?)

[ ] worksheet processes using server on remote machine

[ ] worksheet processes using fork

[ ] worksheet process using multiprocessing 

[ ] genuine infinite undo implemented not using stupid snapshots but a revision
log

[ ] @interact: make it so docstring of function is somehow nicely typeset and
accessible

[ ] @interact's that can be included with sage

[ ] "browse your computer" field of upload is not editable.  fix that.

[ ] improve tracebacks of % modes, e.g., %python then 1/0 is ugly.

[ ] and small hint about google accounts: in gmail at the bottom is a
"last account activity" line and if you click on details, you can see
what has happened recently. login IPs, type and time. you can also
invalidate all other sessions on other PCs where cookies are stored.

[ ] somehow connect http://qwebirc.org with Sage?

[ ] statistics of notebooks, e.g., how many per user, names of all
users, how many users?

[ ] a way to put a code block between two text blocks that lie one
right after the other.

[ ] component architecture (??): see Brickenstein sage-devel email 
  that mentions http://python-rum.org/browser/rum/component.py

[ ] use memory mapped files for worksheet processes??
http://docs.python.org/library/mmap.html
